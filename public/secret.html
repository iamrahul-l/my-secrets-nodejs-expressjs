  <h1>Gamer Secrets</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Always adjust your brightness settings to the max in dark games like horror or stealth-based titles. This can
      help you spot enemies hiding in shadows.</li>
    <li>When playing multiplayer games, use a custom keyboard shortcut for frequently used actions or items. It can give
      you a split-second advantage.</li>
    <li>Don’t skip in-game tutorials, even if you’re familiar with the genre. Developers often include unique mechanics
      that you might miss.</li>
    <li>If you're gaming on a PC, close unnecessary background applications to free up RAM and improve performance.</li>
    <li>Learn to play with multiple types of control schemes (keyboard, controller, mouse) so you can switch based on
      what gives you the best performance in a particular game.</li>
    <li>In competitive games, watch replays of your losses. It helps you understand your mistakes and learn how to
      counter specific strategies in the future.</li>
    <li>If your favorite game includes a day-night cycle, pay attention to how the environment and enemies change with
      time. Some quests or opportunities are only available during certain times.</li>
  </ul>
