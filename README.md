Sure! Hereâ€™s a corrected and formatted version of your README for the **Express Password Check App**. I have fixed the indentation, spacing, and formatting issues to make it clearer and more consistent.

# Express Password Check App

This is a simple Node.js application using Express.js that verifies a password entered by the user. If the correct password is entered, the user is granted access to a secret page.

## Features
- User can enter a password.
- If the password is correct (`rahul`), the user is redirected to a secret page.
- If the password is incorrect, the user remains on the input page.

## Technologies Used
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Body-Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/my-secrets-nodejs-expressjs.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-secrets-nodejs-expressjs
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

To use the application:
- Enter the password in the input field on the home page.
- If you enter the correct password (`rahul`), you will be redirected to the secret page.
- If the password is incorrect, you will remain on the home page.

## Endpoints

### `GET /`
- Serves the home page (`index.html`).

### `POST /check`
